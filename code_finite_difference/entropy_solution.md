Let’s address your confusion about the statement in the proof: *"Combined with the assumption that the numerical flux is Lipschitz continuous, this yields"* the convergence of the last term, specifically:

\[
\lim_{l \to \infty} h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} = \int_{\Omega_t} \int_{\Omega_x} f(u) \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \, dx \, dt
\]

You’ve asked two key questions:
1. **What is the function of the bounded total variation, \( TV(U^n) \leq R \)?**
2. **How do we derive this last convergence?**

I’ll explain these step-by-step in a clear and self-contained manner, focusing on the roles of the bounded total variation and the Lipschitz continuity of the numerical flux, and how they ensure the discrete sum converges to the desired integral.

---

### Background Assumptions

First, let’s establish the key properties from the problem:

- **Conservation Form**: The numerical scheme is given in conservation form, typically expressed as:
  \[
  U_j^{n+1} = U_j^n - \frac{k_l}{h_l} \left( F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - F(U_{j-1}^n, U_j^n) \right)
  \]
  where \( F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) \) is the numerical flux, \( h_l \) is the spatial mesh size, and \( k_l \) is the time step, both approaching zero as \( l \to \infty \).

- **Consistency**: The numerical flux is consistent with the physical flux \( f(u) \), meaning:
  \[
  F(u, u) = f(u)
  \]
  If the solution were smooth and \( U_j^n = U_{j+1}^n = u \), the numerical flux would exactly match the true flux.

- **Lipschitz Continuity**: The numerical flux \( F(a, b) \) is Lipschitz continuous, so there exists a constant \( L \) such that:
  \[
  |F(a, b) - F(c, d)| \leq L (|a - c| + |b - d|)
  \]
  This controls how much \( F \) changes with its arguments.

- **Bounded Total Variation**: The total variation of the numerical solution at each time step is bounded:
  \[
  TV(U^n) = \sup_{\text{partitions}} \sum_j |U_{j+1}^n - U_j^n| \leq R
  \]
  This means the solution’s oscillations are finite, a critical property for solutions to conservation laws.

- **L1 Convergence**: The numerical solution converges to \( u \) in \( L^1 \):
  \[
  \lim_{l \to \infty} \sum_{j, n} |U_j^n - u(x_j, t^n)| h_l k_l = 0
  \]
  Here, \( U_j^n \) approximates \( u(x_j, t^n) \), where \( x_j = j h_l \) and \( t^n = n k_l \).

- **Test Function**: \( \phi(x, t) \) is smooth and compactly supported, so \( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \) is bounded, and \( \phi \) vanishes near the boundaries.

Our goal is to show that the discrete term involving the numerical flux converges to the integral with the true flux \( f(u) \), and to clarify the roles of the total variation bound and Lipschitz continuity.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Discrete Term

The term we need to analyze is:

\[
h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l}
\]

- \( \phi_j^n = \phi(x_j, t^n) \), where \( x_j = j h_l \) and \( t^n = n k_l \).
- \( \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} \) approximates \( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \) because \( \phi \) is smooth. By the mean value theorem:
  \[
  \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(\xi_j^n, t^n), \quad \xi_j^n \in (x_j, x_{j+1})
  \]
  As \( h_l \to 0 \), this becomes closer to \( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x_j, t^n) \).

- The factor \( h_l k_l \) is the area of a spacetime cell, suggesting this sum is a Riemann sum approximating an integral over \( \Omega_x \times \Omega_t \).

If the solution were smooth and \( U_j^n = U_{j+1}^n \approx u(x_j, t^n) \), then by consistency, \( F(U_j^n, U_j^n) = f(u(x_j, t^n)) \), and the sum would resemble:

\[
h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} f(u(x_j, t^n)) \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x_j, t^n)
\]

This converges to \( \int_{\Omega_t} \int_{\Omega_x} f(u) \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \, dx \, dt \) as \( h_l, k_l \to 0 \). However, \( U_j^n \) and \( U_{j+1}^n \) may differ, especially since the solution \( u \) has bounded variation and may have discontinuities. We need to bridge \( F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) \) to \( f(u) \).

---

### Step 2: Decomposing the Numerical Flux

To handle the difference between \( F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) \) and \( f(u) \), split the numerical flux:

\[
F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) = f(U_j^n) + [F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n)]
\]

Then the sum becomes:

\[
h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} = h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} f(U_j^n) \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} + h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} [F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n)] \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l}
\]

Let’s call these:
- **Main Term**: \( h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} f(U_j^n) \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} \)
- **Error Term**: \( h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} [F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n)] \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} \)

We need:
1. The Main Term to converge to the integral.
2. The Error Term to vanish as \( l \to \infty \).

---

### Step 3: Role of Bounded Total Variation and Lipschitz Continuity

#### Error Term Analysis

Consider the difference \( F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n) \). Since \( f(U_j^n) = F(U_j^n, U_j^n) \) by consistency:

\[
|F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n)| = |F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - F(U_j^n, U_j^n)| \leq L |U_{j+1}^n - U_j^n|
\]

using the Lipschitz continuity of \( F \). Now, bound the Error Term:

\[
\left| h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} [F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n)] \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} \right| \leq h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} |F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n)| \left| \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} \right|
\]

- **Flux Difference**: \( |F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n)| \leq L |U_{j+1}^n - U_j^n| \).
- **Test Function Difference**: Since \( \phi \) is smooth, \( \left| \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} \right| = \left| \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(\xi_j^n, t^n) \right| \leq M \), where \( M = \sup |\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}| < \infty \).

Thus:

\[
\left| h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} [F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n)] \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} \right| \leq h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} L |U_{j+1}^n - U_j^n| M
\]

Rewrite the sum:

\[
h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} |U_{j+1}^n - U_j^n| = k_l \sum_n h_l \sum_j |U_{j+1}^n - U_j^n|
\]

Since \( TV(U^n) \leq R \), we have \( \sum_j |U_{j+1}^n - U_j^n| \leq R \) for each \( n \). The number of time steps is \( N = T / k_l \) (assuming \( t^n \) covers \( [0, T] \)), so:

\[
k_l \sum_n h_l \sum_j |U_{j+1}^n - U_j^n| \leq k_l \sum_n h_l R = k_l \cdot N \cdot h_l R = T h_l R
\]

Thus:

\[
\left| h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} [F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n)] \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} \right| \leq L M T h_l R
\]

As \( l \to \infty \), \( h_l \to 0 \), so this term approaches zero:

\[
\lim_{l \to \infty} h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} [F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n)] \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} = 0
\]

**Function of \( TV(U^n) \leq R \)**: The bounded total variation ensures that \( \sum_j |U_{j+1}^n - U_j^n| \leq R \), limiting the cumulative difference between adjacent grid points. Combined with Lipschitz continuity, it controls the error \( F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) - f(U_j^n) \), making the Error Term vanish in the limit.

---

### Step 4: Main Term Convergence

Now, consider:

\[
h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} f(U_j^n) \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} = k_l \sum_n \sum_j f(U_j^n) (\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n)
\]

Define a piecewise constant approximation:
- \( U^l(x, t) = U_j^n \) for \( x \in [x_j, x_{j+1}) \), \( t \in [t^n, t^{n+1}) \).

For each time \( t^n \):

\[
\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n = \int_{x_j}^{x_{j+1}} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x, t^n) \, dx
\]

So:

\[
\sum_j f(U_j^n) (\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n) = \sum_j f(U_j^n) \int_{x_j}^{x_{j+1}} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x, t^n) \, dx = \int_{\Omega_x} f(U^l(x, t^n)) \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x, t^n) \, dx
\]

Then:

\[
k_l \sum_n \sum_j f(U_j^n) (\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n) = k_l \sum_n \int_{\Omega_x} f(U^l(x, t^n)) \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x, t^n) \, dx
\]

This is a Riemann sum over time. Since:
- \( U^l \to u \) in \( L^1 \),
- \( f \) is continuous (typical for conservation laws),
- \( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \) is smooth and bounded,

we have \( f(U^l) \to f(u) \) in \( L^1 \). For each \( t \), as \( h_l \to 0 \):

\[
\int_{\Omega_x} f(U^l(x, t^n)) \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x, t^n) \, dx \to \int_{\Omega_x} f(u(x, t^n)) \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x, t^n) \, dx
\]

Over time, as \( k_l \to 0 \), the sum \( k_l \sum_n \) approximates \( \int_0^T \), yielding:

\[
\lim_{l \to \infty} k_l \sum_n \int_{\Omega_x} f(U^l(x, t^n)) \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x, t^n) \, dx = \int_{\Omega_t} \int_{\Omega_x} f(u) \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \, dx \, dt
\]

---

### Step 5: Combining Results

Since the Error Term vanishes and the Main Term converges:

\[
\lim_{l \to \infty} h_l k_l \sum_{j, n} F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) \frac{\phi_{j+1}^n - \phi_j^n}{h_l} = \int_{\Omega_t} \int_{\Omega_x} f(u) \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \, dx \, dt
\]

- **Lipschitz Continuity**: Ensures \( F(U_j^n, U_{j+1}^n) \) doesn’t deviate too far from \( f(U_j^n) \) when \( U_j^n \) and \( U_{j+1}^n \) are close, quantifiable via \( |U_{j+1}^n - U_j^n| \).
- **Bounded Total Variation**: Guarantees that the sum of \( |U_{j+1}^n - U_j^n| \) is finite, allowing the error to be controlled as the mesh refines.

Together, they bridge the discrete numerical flux to the continuous flux in the weak form, completing the proof that \( u \) is a weak solution.

--- 

### Final Clarification

The statement *"Combined with the assumption that the numerical flux is Lipschitz continuous, this yields"* means that Lipschitz continuity and bounded total variation work together to ensure the numerical flux approximates the true flux in the limit, leveraging the scheme’s convergence properties. The derivation relies on splitting the sum, controlling the error with \( TV(U^n) \leq R \), and using \( L^1 \) convergence for the main term.


Let’s explore why we extend the conservation law \( u_t + (f(u))_x = 0 \) to include entropy pairs \( (\eta(u), \psi(u)) \), and why Theorems 2.8 and 2.9 are essential in this context. We’ll also address why Theorem 2.8 might seem obvious for smooth solutions but requires careful consideration for weak solutions.

---

### Motivation for Extending to Entropy Pairs

The conservation law \( u_t + (f(u))_x = 0 \) describes systems where a quantity \( u \) (e.g., density or momentum) is conserved, with \( f(u) \) as its flux. This partial differential equation (PDE) arises in models like fluid dynamics or traffic flow. However, when \( f(u) \) is nonlinear, solutions can develop discontinuities, such as shocks, even from smooth initial conditions. To handle these, we use **weak solutions**, which satisfy the PDE in an integral sense rather than pointwise.

#### The Challenge of Non-Uniqueness
Weak solutions, while flexible, introduce a problem: they are not unique. For instance, in Burgers’ equation \( u_t + \left( \frac{u^2}{2} \right)_x = 0 \), both a shock wave and a rarefaction wave can be weak solutions for the same initial data. This non-uniqueness is problematic because physical systems typically have a single, meaningful solution. We need a way to select the **physically relevant** weak solution.

#### The Role of the Entropy Condition
In physics, entropy often increases across shocks, providing a natural criterion to identify admissible solutions. Mathematically, this is formalized through the **entropy condition**. We introduce an entropy function \( \eta(u) \) and an associated entropy flux \( \psi(u) \), forming an **entropy pair** \( (\eta(u), \psi(u)) \). These are defined such that, for smooth solutions of \( u_t + (f(u))_x = 0 \), the following holds:

\[
\eta(u)_t + \psi(u)_x = 0
\]

The entropy flux \( \psi(u) \) is related to the conservation law’s flux by the compatibility condition:

\[
\psi'(u) = f'(u) \eta'(u)
\]

For weak solutions, which may include discontinuities, we require a stronger condition: the entropy inequality

\[
\eta(u)_t + \psi(u)_x \leq 0
\]

in the sense of distributions. This inequality ensures that entropy increases (or does not decrease) across shocks, filtering out non-physical solutions like expansion shocks. We also assume \( \eta(u) \) is convex, which aligns with physical notions of entropy and ensures mathematical stability in the analysis.

#### Why Entropy Pairs?
Extending the conservation law to include entropy pairs provides a systematic way to enforce the entropy condition. By defining \( (\eta(u), \psi(u)) \), we gain a tool to test whether a weak solution respects physical principles, thus resolving the non-uniqueness issue and selecting the correct solution.

---

### Why We Need Theorems 2.8 and 2.9

Theorems 2.8 and 2.9 establish a rigorous connection between the entropy condition and the properties of weak entropy solutions. Let’s examine each.

#### Theorem 2.8: Necessity of the Entropy Inequality
- **Statement**: For an entropy pair \( (\eta, \psi) \) with \( \psi' = f' \eta' \), where \( \eta \) is convex, and \( u \) is a weak entropy solution to \( u_t + (f(u))_x = 0 \), it holds that:

\[
\eta(u)_t + \psi(u)_x \leq 0
\]

in a weak sense.

- **Purpose**: This theorem confirms that any weak solution deemed an “entropy solution” (i.e., physically admissible) must satisfy the entropy inequality. It’s a necessary condition, ensuring that the solution aligns with the entropy condition across discontinuities.

#### Theorem 2.9: Sufficiency of the Entropy Inequality
- **Statement**: If \( u \) is a weak solution to \( u_t + (f(u))_x = 0 \) with a convex flux \( f \), and there exists an entropy pair \( (\eta, \psi) \) with \( \psi' = f' \eta' \) and \( \eta \) convex such that:

\[
\eta(u)_t + \psi(u)_x \leq 0
\]

in a weak sense, then \( u \) is a weak entropy solution.

- **Purpose**: This theorem provides a sufficient condition. If a weak solution satisfies the entropy inequality for some convex entropy pair, it qualifies as an entropy solution, meaning it’s the physically relevant one.

#### Their Combined Importance
- **Necessity and Sufficiency**: Theorem 2.8 ensures that entropy solutions obey the entropy inequality, while Theorem 2.9 guarantees that satisfying this inequality (under convexity assumptions) identifies an entropy solution. Together, they form a two-way bridge between the entropy condition and solution uniqueness.
- **Practical Impact**: These theorems enable us to prove that the entropy condition selects a unique, physically meaningful solution among many possible weak solutions, grounding the theory in a mathematically sound framework.

---

### Why Theorem 2.8 Seems Obvious for Smooth Solutions

You noted that, per the definition of an entropy pair, \( \eta(u)_t + \psi(u)_x = 0 \) holds for smooth solutions, so Theorem 2.8’s inequality \( \eta(u)_t + \psi(u)_x \leq 0 \) might seem trivial. Let’s clarify this.

#### For Smooth Solutions
If \( u \) is a smooth solution to \( u_t + (f(u))_x = 0 \), we can compute using the chain rule:

\[
\eta(u)_t = \eta'(u) u_t, \quad \psi(u)_x = \psi'(u) u_x
\]

Given \( \psi'(u) = f'(u) \eta'(u) \), we get:

\[
\eta(u)_t + \psi(u)_x = \eta'(u) u_t + \psi'(u) u_x = \eta'(u) u_t + f'(u) \eta'(u) u_x = \eta'(u) \left( u_t + f'(u) u_x \right)
\]

Since \( u_t + f'(u) u_x = u_t + (f(u))_x = 0 \) for a smooth solution, it follows that:

\[
\eta(u)_t + \psi(u)_x = \eta'(u) \cdot 0 = 0
\]

So, for smooth solutions, the equality \( \eta(u)_t + \psi(u)_x = 0 \) holds, which satisfies the inequality \( \leq 0 \). This aligns with the definition of an entropy pair and might make Theorem 2.8 appear obvious in this case.

#### For Weak Solutions
However, Theorem 2.8 applies to **weak entropy solutions**, which may include discontinuities where smoothness fails. Here, the chain rule doesn’t apply directly, and we work in the distributional sense:

\[
\int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left( \eta(u) \phi_t + \psi(u) \phi_x \right) \, dx \, dt \geq 0
\]

for all non-negative test functions \( \phi \). The inequality \( \eta(u)_t + \psi(u)_x \leq 0 \) ensures that entropy increases across shocks, a requirement that’s not automatic and must be verified. Theorem 2.8 guarantees this holds for weak entropy solutions, which is non-trivial because it involves analyzing behavior at discontinuities, often via jump conditions.

#### Why It’s Not Trivial
While the equality is straightforward for smooth solutions, establishing the inequality for weak solutions requires proving that the entropy condition is satisfied across shocks. This involves detailed analysis (e.g., Rankine-Hugoniot conditions and entropy jump conditions), making Theorem 2.8 a significant result beyond the smooth case.

---

### Summary
- **Entropy Pairs**: We extend \( u_t + (f(u))_x = 0 \) to include \( (\eta(u), \psi(u)) \) to impose an entropy condition, resolving the non-uniqueness of weak solutions by selecting the physically admissible one.
- **Theorems 2.8 and 2.9**: They provide the necessary and sufficient conditions linking the entropy inequality to weak entropy solutions, ensuring a unique, meaningful solution.
- **Smooth vs. Weak**: For smooth solutions, \( \eta(u)_t + \psi(u)_x = 0 \) holds naturally, but Theorem 2.8’s importance lies in its application to weak solutions, where the inequality ensures physical consistency.

This framework is fundamental to the theory of conservation laws, blending physical intuition with mathematical rigor.
