[An Interactive Tutorial on Numerical Optimization](https://www.benfrederickson.com/numerical-optimization/) implements the
visualization of some commonly used methods in Numerical Optimization: Nelder-Mead, Gradient Descent, Conjugate Gradient...

Sebastian Ruder dives into [gradient descent methods](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) deeply, especially for 
> the stochastic gradient descent on large sparse models like those used to train deep neural networks.
